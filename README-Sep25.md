Give me a detailed prompt which when issued will allow me to move away from this chat conversation to another new conversation and help the AI restore full context . I will obviously be supplying the complete code in the new conversation along with the prompt

Describe in detail, the requirements, the significant steps, the learnings , what is completed ,what all is still remaining.

Of course. This is an excellent practice for maintaining context and ensuring smooth collaboration. Creating a "context restoration" prompt is a powerful way to encapsulate a project's journey.

Here is a detailed, structured prompt designed to be given to an AI along with the final, complete codebase. It covers the project's history, architecture, key decisions, and a clear roadmap for what's next.

### **Definitive Prompt for Full AI Context Restoration**

**Project Title:** SevaConnect Halasuru (RKM Attendance App) - Context & Status Debrief

**Your Role:** You are an expert senior Android developer and UI/UX designer. Your task is to fully absorb the following project context, review the accompanying complete codebase, and then seamlessly continue our collaboration.

### **Part I: The Project's Journey & Evolution**

**1. Genesis: The Original Goal**
The project's mission was to replace an inefficient, paper-based system for managing event attendance at Ramakrishna Math, Halasuru. The core problems to solve were data entry errors, duplication of effort, and a lack of real-time data on event day. The initial concept involved two primary user roles: an **Admin** for setup and a volunteer **Operator** for on-site execution.

**2. Key Design Evolutions & Critical Decisions (The "Why")**
Our iterative process led to several critical design improvements that have fundamentally shaped the final product. Understanding these decisions is key to understanding the current architecture.

*   **From Manual Flag to "Smart Schedule":** We discarded the initial idea of an Admin manually flagging an event as "active." We replaced it with a more robust system using an "Active Window" (`active_from_ts` and `active_until_ts`). The app now *automatically* determines the active event based on the current time, making the Operator's experience seamless.

*   **From Two Modes to a Three-Tiered Privilege System:** We evolved the simple "Admin/Operator" split into a more granular and secure three-role system, each with specific, logical permissions:
    1.  **Operator:** The default, no-login mode for on-site attendance marking.
    2.  **Event Coordinator:** A mid-level admin (PIN protected) who can manage *upcoming* events but cannot alter the master devotee list or delete historical data.
    3.  **Super Admin:** The highest level (separate PIN), with full CRUD access to all data, including backups and user management (in the future).

*   **From Ambiguous to Explicit Attendance Schema:** We identified that a simple counter (`cnt`) for attendance was insufficient. We added a `reg_type` column to the `attendance` table to explicitly distinguish between a "PRE_REG" devotee and a "SPOT_REG" devotee. This was critical for accurate reporting and the Operator's UI.

*   **From Hiding to Disabling (A Superior UX):** We refined privilege rules. Instead of hiding the "Edit" button for past events from a Coordinator, we now **disable and grey it out**, which transparently communicates the rule to the user.

*   **From "Save and Auto-Dialog" to "Save and Auto-Search" (A More Flexible Workflow):** We designed and implemented a superior workflow for adding new devotees on the spot. Instead of automatically popping up a dialog (which was inflexible), the app now saves the new devotee and then automatically searches for them, presenting them in the search results. This creates a single, consistent workflow for handling all walk-ins, whether they are new or existing.

### **Part II: Key Learnings & Challenges**

*   **Learning 1: The Primacy of Robust State Management.** A "disappearing delete button" bug was a classic Android issue caused by the Activity Lifecycle. This forced a refactoring to a **Shared ViewModel** (`AdminViewModel`), which is the modern, correct pattern for managing state shared between an Activity and its Fragments.

*   **Learning 2: The Danger of Device-Specific UI Bugs.** We encountered and fixed several critical UI bugs that only appeared on a physical device (Redmi) and not the emulator. These included truncated `ActionBar` subtitles and invisible `TextViews` due to theme inconsistencies. The key lessons were to **always test on physical hardware** and to create robust UIs by using theme-aware attributes and safe, programmatic adjustments.

*   **Learning 3: The Importance of a Clean Build and Release Process.** We encountered and solved issues related to `BuildConfig` generation and the absolute requirement for **signing release APKs** with a private keystore, solidifying the production-readiness of the app.

### **Part III: What is Completed (Current State)**

The application is now **stable and feature-rich for its V1 demo.**

*   **Architecture:** Follows a modern `Fragment -> ViewModel -> Repository -> DAO` pattern.
*   **Privilege System:** The three-tiered login flow is fully implemented and respected throughout the app. The login screens are polished with a modern "No Action Bar" theme and the official logo.
*   **Operator Mode:** Feature-complete. Includes smart search with debounce, three-state results (Pre-Reg, Walk-in, Present), a modernized and polished confirmation dialog, and the seamless "Save and Auto-Search" workflow for on-the-spot registration.
*   **Admin Mode:** Full CRUD for Events and Devotees is implemented, with UI elements correctly enabled/disabled based on privilege and event status.
*   **CSV Imports:** Full implementation for Master Devotee List, Per-Event Attendance, and WhatsApp Group List, all with intelligent column mapping.
*   **Reports:** The Reports Dashboard is functional with two key reports: a Master Devotee Report and an Attendance By Event report.
*   **Data Management:**
    *   A robust **"About" screen** is accessible from all modes, providing version info and a clickable feedback email that includes the app version.
    *   A production-ready **"Local Backup & Restore"** feature allows the Super Admin to export the full database to a timestamped `.zip` file via the Android Share Sheet and to restore from either a `.zip` or a clean `.db` file.
*   **Code Quality:** All logging has been centralized into a production-ready `AppLogger` that automatically disables verbose logs in release builds. All known device-specific UI bugs have been fixed.

### **Part IV: What is Remaining (The Deferred `TODO` List)**

We have explicitly decided to defer the following features for a post-V1 release. The app is considered complete for its initial demo without them.

1.  **Cloud Backup & Restore:** The full implementation of the Google Drive integration, including the "intelligent" `WorkManager` for automatic daily backups, cloud restore, and the associated UI on the Backup & Restore screen.
2.  **PIN Management:** A screen, accessible only to the Super Admin, to change the PINs for both the Super Admin and Event Coordinator roles.
3.  **"Today's Schedule" Screen:** A new screen to handle the edge case where multiple events are scheduled for the same day, allowing the operator to choose which one to open.
4.  **Role Selection Button Hierarchy:** A minor UX tweak to improve the visual priority of the buttons on the "Select Your Role" screen.

### **Your Task**

1.  Review this document and the complete codebase to gain full context of our journey and final decisions.
2.  Confirm you are synchronized and ready to proceed.
3.  The application is now ready for the demo. The next logical block of work, when we resume development, will be to begin implementing the **Deferred `TODO` List**, starting with the **Cloud Backup & Restore** feature, which will require setting up the Google Drive API integration.
