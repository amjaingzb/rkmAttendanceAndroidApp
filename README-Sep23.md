### **Definitive Prompt for Full AI Context Restoration**

**Project Title:** RKM Attendance App - Context & Status Debrief

**Objective:** This document provides a comprehensive overview of the "RKM Attendance App" project. Your role is to fully absorb this context, review the accompanying complete codebase, and then seamlessly continue our collaboration as an expert Android programmer and UI/UX designer.

### **Part I: The Project's Journey & Evolution**

**1. Genesis: The Original Goal**
The project's mission was to replace an inefficient, paper-based system for managing event attendance. The core problems to solve were data entry errors, duplication of effort (manual ticking followed by digitization), and a lack of real-time data on event day. The initial concept was a desktop application ported to Android, with two primary user roles: an **Admin** for setup and a volunteer **Operator** for on-site execution.

**2. Key Design Evolutions & Critical Decisions**
Our iterative process led to several critical design improvements that have fundamentally shaped the final product. Understanding these decisions is key to understanding the current architecture.

*   **From Manual Flag to "Smart Schedule":** We discarded the initial idea of an Admin manually flagging an event as "active." We replaced it with a more robust and error-proof system using an "Active Window" (`active_from_ts` and `active_until_ts`). The app now *automatically* determines the active event based on the current time. We also added a crucial data integrity rule to prevent admins from creating events with overlapping time windows.

*   **From Two Modes to a Three-Tiered Privilege System:** We evolved the simple "Admin/Operator" split into a more granular and secure three-role system, each with specific, logical permissions:
    1.  **Operator:** The default, no-login mode for on-site attendance marking.
    2.  **Event Coordinator:** A mid-level admin (PIN protected) who can manage *upcoming* events but cannot alter the master devotee list or delete historical data.
    3.  **Super Admin:** The highest level (separate PIN), with full CRUD access to all data, ensuring a clear separation of duties.

*   **From Ambiguous to Explicit Attendance Schema:** We identified that a simple counter (`cnt`) for attendance was insufficient. We added a `reg_type` column to the `attendance` table to explicitly distinguish between a "PRE_REG" devotee (pre-registered, not yet arrived) and a "SPOT_REG" devotee (a walk-in). This was critical for accurate reporting and the Operator's UI.

*   **From Hiding to Disabling (A Superior UX):** We refined our privilege rules. Instead of hiding the "Edit" button for past events from a Coordinator (which is confusing), we now **disable and grey it out**. This transparently communicates the rule to the user.

*   **From Static to a Confirmation Workflow (Operator Search):** We improved the Operator's workflow. Instead of a simple tap immediately marking someone present, the user is now shown a **confirmation dialog**. This dialog displays key details (Name, Status, WhatsApp Group) and provides clear action buttons ("Mark as Present", "Cancel"). This prevents accidental clicks, provides crucial feedback, and creates a hook for future actions (like sending a WhatsApp invite). The search results then refresh in place upon confirmation.

### **Part II: Key Learnings & Challenges**

*   **Learning 1: The Danger of Unstable Third-Party Dependencies.** Our biggest time sink was the repeated failure of external PIN entry libraries. The key lesson was that for simple, critical UI components, building them natively is far more reliable. We now prefer Maven Central over JitPack.

*   **Learning 2: The "Porting Blind Spot" - Logic in the UI Layer.** We encountered a critical bug where new devotee data was being discarded because the complex "merge" logic was part of the old desktop app's UI code and was not ported correctly. The lesson was to be vigilant for business logic "hiding" in the UI layer and to **extract this complex orchestration logic into the Repository layer**.

*   **Learning 3: The Primacy of Robust State Management.** A "disappearing delete button" bug was a classic Android issue caused by the Activity Lifecycle. This forced a refactoring to a **Shared ViewModel** (`AdminViewModel`), which is the modern, correct architectural pattern for managing state that needs to be shared between an Activity and its Fragments, making the admin section fundamentally more stable.

### **Part III: What is Completed (Current State)**

The application is now **feature-complete** regarding its core data management lifecycle.

*   **Architecture:** `Fragment -> ViewModel -> Repository -> DAO` with a Shared ViewModel for admin state.
*   **Privilege System:** The three-tiered login flow is fully implemented and respected throughout the app.
*   **Operator Mode:** Feature-complete. Includes smart search with debounce, three-state results (Pre-Reg, Walk-in, Present), the confirmation dialog workflow, and on-the-spot registration.
*   **Admin Mode:** Full CRUD for Events and Devotees is implemented, with UI elements (buttons, tabs) correctly enabled, disabled, or hidden based on privilege and event status (past/present).
*   **CSV Imports (Complete):**
    *   **Master Devotee List:** Full implementation with column mapping, `DROP`/`RETAIN` logic, a toggle for unmapped fields, and `extra_json` data merging.
    *   **Per-Event Attendance:** Full implementation, respecting Coordinator/Admin privileges (Coordinators cannot import for past events; Admins can import a `count` field for historical data).
    *   **WhatsApp Group List:** Full implementation for the Super Admin, including the UI payoff (status icons in the Operator search results).
*   **Reports (Complete):**
    *   The Reports Dashboard UI has been polished for readability.
    *   **Master Devotee Report:** A consolidated report, viewable in-app and exportable to CSV via the Share Sheet. It lists all devotees, sorted by engagement (`last_seen`, `total_attendance`).
    *   **Attendance By Event:** A streamlined, single-screen report allowing admins to select an event and directly export its attendee list via the Share Sheet.
*   **Code Quality:** All recent features have been built with a focus on fixing data integrity bugs (e.g., `updated_at` timestamps, age/JSON merging), race conditions (e.g., the two-pass import), and improving UX (e.g., auto-mapping logic, confirmation dialogs).

### **Part IV: What is Remaining (The Final `TODO` List)**

We are in the final "polish and harden" phase. The codebase you will receive reflects the completion of all work described above. The remaining tasks are:

1.  **PIN Management:** The last deferred core feature. A screen, accessible only to the Super Admin, to change the PINs for both the Super Admin and Event Coordinator roles.
2.  **Deferred UI/UX Polish:**
    *   Improve the visual hierarchy of the `RoleSelectionActivity` buttons.
    *   Improve the readability of the "Checked-in Attendees" title in `MarkAttendanceActivity`.
    *   Implement the "Today's Schedule" screen for the edge case where multiple events are active on the same day.
3.  **Dynamic Toolbar Titles:** The toolbar title in `AdminMainActivity` should update to display "Events", "Devotees", or "Reports" corresponding to the active tab.

**Your Task:**
1.  Review this document and the complete codebase to gain full context.
2.  Confirm you are synchronized and ready to proceed.
3.  Begin work on the **remaining `TODO` list**. The next logical block of work is to address the final **UI/UX Polish** items, starting with the **"Dynamic Toolbar Titles"**.

I am building an android app. Please build your context by going through the attached readme file and the complete code. Ask me if you have doubts before we begin working.
And I can supply you answers and more readmes



###TAG-CONVERSATION-2025-09-23 12:11:19

Hello! Thank you for providing such a detailed and well-structured context document and the complete codebase. I have thoroughly reviewed the `README-Sep23.md` file and analyzed the provided source code files.

My understanding is as follows:

*   **Project Goal:** To create a robust Android application for managing event attendance, replacing a manual paper-based system. It's built around a clear, three-tiered privilege system (Operator, Event Coordinator, Super Admin).
*   **Current Status:** The application is feature-complete. All core functionalities, including the privilege system, operator mode for attendance marking, admin mode for CRUD operations on events and devotees, comprehensive CSV import/export features, and detailed reporting, are fully implemented and functional.
*   **Architecture:** The app follows a modern Android architecture (`Fragment -> ViewModel -> Repository -> DAO`) and correctly uses a `Shared ViewModel` (`AdminViewModel`) to manage state across the admin UI, which was a key learning and bug fix during development.
*   **Key Learnings:** You've overcome significant challenges, notably by moving away from unreliable third-party libraries, ensuring business logic resides in the repository layer, and correctly managing UI state with ViewModels.
*   **Remaining Tasks:** We are now in the final "polish and harden" phase. The remaining work is clearly defined:
    1.  **PIN Management:** A new screen for the Super Admin to change PINs.
    2.  **UI/UX Polish:** Minor but important visual improvements to the Role Selection, Mark Attendance, and a new "Today's Schedule" screen for a specific edge case.
    3.  **Dynamic Toolbar Titles:** Making the main admin screen's toolbar title reflect the currently selected tab.

I have successfully built the full context of the project's history, architecture, and current state. The information provided is clear, and I have no immediate doubts.

I am synchronized and ready to proceed. As per your instructions, the next logical step is to begin work on the remaining `TODO` list, starting with the **"Dynamic Toolbar Titles"**.

Please confirm, and we can begin tackling that task.
