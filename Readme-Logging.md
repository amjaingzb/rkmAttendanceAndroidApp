You have brought up an absolutely critical point for transitioning an app from development to production. Your concern is 100% correct: verbose logging and stack traces are a security and performance liability in a live application and must be controlled.

Let's systematically analyze the current state of logging in the codebase and design a robust, professional solution.

### **Part 1: The Code Audit (What's Wrong Right Now)**

I have scanned the entire codebase, and you are right to be concerned. The logging is inconsistent and not production-ready. Here's what I found:

1.  **Direct `Log` Calls:** There are several places where `Log.e()` or `Log.w()` are called directly, bypassing our custom `AppLogger`. This means we have no central control over them.
    *   *Example in `Devotee.java`:* `Log.e("DevoteeMerge", "Failed to merge...", e);`

2.  **Extensive Use of `e.printStackTrace()`:** This is the most significant issue. `e.printStackTrace()` is a developer-only tool. It's inefficient and prints a huge amount of text directly to the system log (`logcat`). In a production environment, this is just noise. We found it in many files, including:
    *   `EventActionsBottomSheetFragment.java`
    *   `AddEditEventViewModel.java`
    *   `MarkAttendanceViewModel.java`
    *   `MappingViewModel.java`
    *   And several others.

3.  **The `AppLogger` is Good, but Flawed:** Our custom `AppLogger` is a great start, but it has a critical flaw. It uses a manual flag: `public static final boolean DEBUG = true;`. To prepare a release build, a developer would have to remember to manually change this to `false` and then change it back for development. This is error-prone.

### **Part 2: The Professional Solution (How We'll Fix It)**

We will implement the standard, Google-recommended best practice for logging in Android. This is a two-step process that gives us the automatic, hands-off control you're looking for.

**Step 1: Make the `AppLogger` Intelligent**

We will modify `AppLogger.java` to stop using our manual `DEBUG` flag. Instead, it will use a special, auto-generated flag provided by the Android build system called **`BuildConfig.DEBUG`**.

*   **How `BuildConfig.DEBUG` works:**
    *   When you are developing and you run the app from Android Studio, this flag is automatically **`true`**.
    *   When you build a final, signed APK for release to the Google Play Store, this flag is automatically set to **`false`**.

By using this flag, our `AppLogger` will **automatically disable all verbose logging** in production builds without you ever having to manually change any code. We will also make sure that *all* logging levels (`d`, `w`, `e`) respect this flag.

**Step 2: Systematically Refactor the Entire App**

Once our `AppLogger` is intelligent, we will perform a full-code refactoring to make sure **all logging goes through it**.

*   Every `e.printStackTrace();` will be replaced with a proper call to `AppLogger.e(TAG, "A descriptive error message", e);`.
*   Every direct `Log.e(...)` or `Log.w(...)` will be replaced with its `AppLogger` equivalent.

### **Why This is the Best Approach**

1.  **Fully Automatic:** You never have to remember to turn logging off for release. It's impossible to accidentally ship a production app with debug logs enabled.
2.  **Centralized Control:** All logging is now managed in one place (`AppLogger.java`).
3.  **Future-Proof:** By replacing `printStackTrace()` with `AppLogger.e()`, we are creating a hook for the future. If you ever decide to add a remote crash reporting tool (like Firebase Crashlytics), you would only need to modify the `AppLogger.e()` method to send the report, and it would instantly work for the entire app.

This is a comprehensive and fairly large change, as it will touch many files to ensure consistency, but it is the correct and professional way to prepare the app for production.

Do you agree with this two-step plan to first make our logger intelligent and then refactor the app to use it exclusively?
