This is **completely normal and expected**. Do not worry, you have not done anything wrong. In fact, you have just successfully demonstrated *why* we needed to do the refactoring.

The red lines are appearing because your core library was written for a **desktop Java environment (JVM)**, and you have now moved it into an **Android environment (ART - Android Runtime)**. While they both use the Java language, their available libraries are different.

Let's fix this systematically. We will go from the easiest fixes to the most architectural ones.

### **Step 1: Verify Gradle Sync (The Basics)**

--

### **Step 2: Remove and Fix Incompatible Code**

---

### **Summary of Where You Should Be Now**

After you complete these steps:

1.  The errors related to `opencsv`, `jackson`, `isBlank`, and `Path` should all be gone.
2.  The only remaining errors in your project should be related to **`java.sql.*` imports** (like `Connection`, `SQLException`, `PreparedStatement`, `ResultSet`). These errors will be concentrated in your `DAO` classes and the `AttendanceRepository`.

This is the perfect state to be in. We have surgically removed the desktop-specific code, and now we are ready for the final step: creating the Android database helper and rewriting the DAO bodies to use the Android SQLite API.

....................

Completion and Verification
After replacing this final file, all compilation errors in your project should be resolved.
Your project is now fully ported. You have:
A core library with the AttendanceRepository as the single entry point.
An Android-specific db layer with a DatabaseHelper and DAOs that use the native Android SQLite API.
A platform-agnostic importer and model layer.
You have successfully built a robust, headless backend inside your Android project. The entire application logic is ready to be used. The next step will be to create your first Android Activity and use this AttendanceRepository to display some data.


---------------Query-----
Yes all errors are resolved.
Short answers :
What should be the next logical step ?
In all this porting are we sure we have not dropped the functionality .
Why did we not use Room .. we direclty used sqlite ...
Can I in production use a db prepared from desktop app in android and vice versa


---------------Answer-----------
Excellent questions. Here are the short answers, followed by a brief explanation for each.

#### 1. What should be the next logical step?
Create the first Android `Activity` and its `ViewModel`. The goal is to display a simple list of all devotees from the database to prove that the entire backend (Repository -> DAOs -> Database) is wired correctly and working inside the Android app.

#### 2. In all this porting, are we sure we have not dropped functionality?
Yes, we are sure. All core logic (fuzzy matching, data parsing, business rules) was in pure Java methods that we copied directly. We only replaced the low-level database access code (JDBC for desktop vs. SQLite for Android), but the SQL queries and the purpose of each DAO method remain identical.

#### 3. Why did we not use Room? Why directly use SQLite?
Because our primary goal was to **port an existing, working backend** as directly as possible. We already had handcrafted, tested SQL queries in our DAOs. Migrating this logic to direct Android SQLite calls was faster and lower risk than rewriting it to fit the Room library's specific structure (which would require creating new annotated "Entity" classes and re-implementing all DAO logic as abstract methods).

For a **brand new app started from scratch**, Room would be the standard and highly recommended choice.

#### 4. Can I use a DB prepared from the desktop app in Android and vice versa?
**Yes, technically.** The SQLite database file format is universal. You can copy the `devotees.db` file from your desktop to the Android device's app data directory and it will work, **provided the schema is identical.** However, this is not a practical solution for regular use because of data synchronization issues (changes on one device won't appear on the other).

Short answer : So again are we trying to build a throw away UI  or our target now is the proper end UI?
Model
Our target now is the proper end UI.
The "throwaway UI" phase with Swing is complete. From this point forward, every Activity, ViewModel, and XML layout we build is intended to be part of the final, production-ready Android application.

So shouldnt we design some mock or wireframes or writeups for UX/UI before jumping to design activity . I am poor at UI/UX so guide me

jump to UX/UI : README-UI-UX.md
