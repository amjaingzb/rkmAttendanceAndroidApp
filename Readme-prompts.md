This is **completely normal and expected**. Do not worry, you have not done anything wrong. In fact, you have just successfully demonstrated *why* we needed to do the refactoring.

The red lines are appearing because your core library was written for a **desktop Java environment (JVM)**, and you have now moved it into an **Android environment (ART - Android Runtime)**. While they both use the Java language, their available libraries are different.

Let's fix this systematically. We will go from the easiest fixes to the most architectural ones.

---

### **Step 1: Verify Gradle Sync (The Basics)**

First, let's be 100% sure the dependencies are correct.
Open your `app/build.gradle` file. The `dependencies` block should look like this. Double-check that you placed the lines inside the correct block and that there are no typos.

```groovy
// In RkmAttendanceApp/app/build.gradle

dependencies {

    // These lines are added by default by Android Studio
    implementation 'androidx.core:core-ktx:1.9.0'
    implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.6.1'
    implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.10.0'
    testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.13.2'
    androidTestImplementation 'androidx.test.ext:junit:1.1.5'
    androidTestImplementation 'androidx.test.espresso:espresso-core:3.5.1'

    // === VERIFY THESE LINES ===
    implementation 'com.opencsv:opencsv:5.9'
    implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.15.2'
}
```
If you made any changes, click **"Sync Now"** again. Look at the "Build" tab at the bottom of Android Studio. If there are any errors there (e.g., "Failed to resolve..."), it means there might be a network issue or a typo.

### **Step 2: Remove and Fix Incompatible Code**

The remaining errors are because of APIs that exist on desktop but not on Android. We will now remove or replace them.

#### **Action 1: Delete `Database.java`**
This is the biggest source of errors. It uses `java.sql.*` (JDBC), which does not exist on Android. It has to be completely replaced.

*   In the Android Studio project tree, navigate to `db/Database.java`.
*   **Right-click on the file and delete it.**

#### **Action 2: Delete `ImportMappingProvider.java`**
This was a UI-related interface for the Swing app. It is now obsolete.

*   Navigate to `importer/ImportMappingProvider.java`.
*   **Right-click and delete it.**

#### **Action 3: Fix the `CsvImporter` Constructor**
Deleting `ImportMappingProvider` will cause an error in `CsvImporter`. Let's fix it.

*   Open `importer/CsvImporter.java`.
*   Find the constructor and remove the `mappingProvider` parameter.

    ```java
    // ========== BEFORE ==========
    public CsvImporter(Connection c, ImportMappingProvider mappingProvider) {
        this.c = c; this.dao = new DevoteeDao(c); this.mappingProvider = mappingProvider;
    }

    // ========== AFTER ==========
    public CsvImporter(Connection c) { // Remove the second parameter
        this.c = c;
        this.dao = new DevoteeDao(c);
        this.mappingProvider = null; // Or just remove the field entirely
    }
    ```
    *Also, find the line `mapping = mappingProvider.getMappingFor(...)` and delete it.*

#### **Action 4: Fix Java 11 APIs (like `String.isBlank()`)**
Your minimum SDK is 26, which uses a version of Java 8. Methods like `String.isBlank()` were added in Java 11 and don't exist.

*   Go to **Edit -> Find -> Replace in Path...**
*   In the top box, enter: `.isBlank()`
*   In the bottom box, enter: `.trim().isEmpty()`
*   Click **"Replace All"**. This will fix this issue everywhere in the project.

#### **Action 5: Replace `java.nio.file.Path`**
The `Path` API is not fully available on older Android versions and is not the standard way to handle files. We should use `java.io.File`.

*   Open `core/AttendanceRepository.java`.
*   Change the signatures of the two importer methods:

    ```java
    // In AttendanceRepository.java
    import java.io.File; // Add this import
    // import java.nio.file.Path; // Remove this import

    // ========== BEFORE ==========
    public CsvImporter.ImportStats importMasterDevoteeList(Path csvFile, ...)
    public AttendanceImporter.Stats importAttendanceList(long eventId, Path csvFile, ...)
    public WhatsAppGroupImporter.Stats importWhatsAppGroups(Path csvFile, ...)

    // ========== AFTER ==========
    public CsvImporter.ImportStats importMasterDevoteeList(File csvFile, ...)
    public AttendanceImporter.Stats importAttendanceList(long eventId, File csvFile, ...)
    public WhatsAppGroupImporter.Stats importWhatsAppGroups(File csvFile, ...)
    ```
*   Now, fix the importer classes themselves to accept `File`:
    *   In `importer/CsvImporter.java`, change `importCsv(Path file, ...)` to `importCsv(File file, ...)`.
    *   In `importer/AttendanceImporter.java`, change `importForEvent(..., Path csvFile, ...)` to `importForEvent(..., File csvFile, ...)`.
    *   In `importer/WhatsAppGroupImporter.java`, change `importCsv(Path csvFile, ...)` to `importCsv(File csvFile, ...)`.
    *   In all three files, change `new FileReader(csvFile.toFile())` to just `new FileReader(csvFile)`.

### **Summary of Where You Should Be Now**

After you complete these steps:

1.  The errors related to `opencsv`, `jackson`, `isBlank`, and `Path` should all be gone.
2.  The only remaining errors in your project should be related to **`java.sql.*` imports** (like `Connection`, `SQLException`, `PreparedStatement`, `ResultSet`). These errors will be concentrated in your `DAO` classes and the `AttendanceRepository`.

This is the perfect state to be in. We have surgically removed the desktop-specific code, and now we are ready for the final step: creating the Android database helper and rewriting the DAO bodies to use the Android SQLite API.

....................

Completion and Verification
After replacing this final file, all compilation errors in your project should be resolved.
Your project is now fully ported. You have:
A core library with the AttendanceRepository as the single entry point.
An Android-specific db layer with a DatabaseHelper and DAOs that use the native Android SQLite API.
A platform-agnostic importer and model layer.
You have successfully built a robust, headless backend inside your Android project. The entire application logic is ready to be used. The next step will be to create your first Android Activity and use this AttendanceRepository to display some data.
