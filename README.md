Important prompts 


Here are multiple multiple prompts which I saved during my app buildup. Please correlate them with the currentState readme file and find if anything is missed
README-Sep13-currentState.md is the latest one . Requirements_attendance.md is the original. then README-PortingPreparation.md and then README-UI-UX.md/Readme-prompts.md


Go through the attached REadme file for getting the full context of the app that we are buidling togather. I have also stitched through all the code into 1 temporary file for your reference. Let me know if this brings you upto full speed on the context or is there any doubt or clarification.
