DEFERRED FEATURES

Excellent. My internal context is now updated: the stat numbers are set to **`16sp`**.

With that, we can consider the UI polish for the `MarkAttendanceActivity` complete. It is now more readable and robust.

---

**`TODO` List Status:**

1.  **PIN Management:** A screen to change the PINs.
2.  **Deferred UI/UX Polish:**
    *   ~~Improve the visual hierarchy of the `RoleSelectionActivity` buttons.~~ (Skipped)
    *   ~~Improve the readability of the title/stats on `MarkAttendanceActivity`.~~ **(Completed)**
    *   **Implement the "Today's Schedule" screen.**
3.  **~~Dynamic Toolbar Titles~~** **(Completed)**

---

The next task on our list is to **implement the "Today's Schedule" screen.**

Let's discuss this feature.

### The Problem (The Edge Case)

Our current startup logic in `LauncherActivity` is designed for a simple scenario: it looks for one "active" event right now. If it finds one, it immediately launches `MarkAttendanceActivity`. If it finds none, it goes to the admin login.

However, the app is sophisticated enough to allow for multiple events on the same day. For example:
*   A "Morning Session" from 8 AM to 1 PM.
*   An "Evening Session" from 6 PM to 9 PM.

If an operator opens the app at 10 AM, it correctly opens the "Morning Session." But what if they open it at 3 PM, when *neither* event is technically active? Or what if the requirement is simply to see all events scheduled for *today*?

The current logic doesn't give the operator a way to choose between events scheduled for the same day, especially if they are opening the app between active time windows.

### The Proposed Solution (The "Today's Schedule" Screen)

We need to introduce a new, simple screen that acts as a daily schedule or chooser.

**Here's the new logic:**

1.  **In `LauncherActivity`:** Instead of just looking for a single event that is active *right now*, we will change the logic to ask the Repository for **all events scheduled for today's date**.
2.  **The Logic Fork:**
    *   If the repository returns **zero** events for today, the app proceeds to the `RoleSelectionActivity` (the admin login) as it does now.
    *   If it returns **exactly one** event for today, the app bypasses the schedule screen and launches `MarkAttendanceActivity` for that single event directly. This keeps the experience fast for the most common scenario.
    *   If it returns **more than one** event for today, the app will launch our new **"Today's Schedule" screen**.
3.  **The "Today's Schedule" Screen UI:**
    *   This will be a very simple new Activity.
    *   It will display a clear title, like "Today's Events (23 Sep 2025)".
    *   It will show a simple list of the events for the day (e.g., "Morning Session", "Evening Session").
    *   The user simply taps on the event they need to work on.
    *   Tapping an event launches `MarkAttendanceActivity` with the correct `eventId`.

**The Benefit:** This makes the app much more robust and flexible. It gracefully handles complex schedules, empowers the operator to make the correct choice, and closes a potential gap in the workflow, all without complicating the common "one-event-per-day" scenario.

What do you think of this plan for handling multiple events on the same day?

That is a very pragmatic and wise decision. It's always best to get a functional Version 1 into the hands of users to gather real-world feedback before building features for edge cases.

I will move the "Today's Schedule" screen to a deferred/post-V1 feature list.

Let's update our status.

---

**`TODO` List Status:**

*   **Immediate `TODO` (Final V1 Task):**
    1.  **PIN Management:** A screen to change the PINs.

*   **Deferred / Post-V1 `TODO`:**
    1.  Implement the "Today's Schedule" screen.
    2.  Improve the visual hierarchy of the `RoleSelectionActivity` buttons.

---

This means we have now arrived at the **last remaining core feature** for Version 1: **PIN Management.**

Let's discuss the requirements for this.

### The Problem

Currently, the PINs for the Event Coordinator ("1111") and Super Admin ("2222") are hardcoded as default values when the database is first created. This is insecure and inflexible. The administrators need a way to change these PINs to a private number of their choosing.

### The Proposed Solution (The "PIN Management" Screen)

We will create a new screen (a new Activity) dedicated to changing these PINs.

**Here's the high-level plan:**

1.  **Access Control:** This new screen must be **exclusively accessible to a logged-in Super Admin**. An Event Coordinator should not be able to see or access this feature. The logical place to put the entry point for this is in the options menu (the three dots) of the `AdminMainActivity`. We would add a "Change PINs" item that is only visible when the `currentPrivilege` is `SUPER_ADMIN`.
2.  **The UI:** The screen itself will be simple:
    *   A field for "New Event Coordinator PIN".
    *   A field for "Confirm Event Coordinator PIN" to prevent typos.
    *   A field for "New Super Admin PIN".
    *   A field for "Confirm Super Admin PIN".
    *   A "Save" button.
3.  **The Logic:**
    *   When the Super Admin clicks "Save", the app will perform validation:
        *   Check that the "New" and "Confirm" PINs match for each role.
        *   Check that the PINs are of a valid format (e.g., exactly 4 digits).
    *   If validation passes, the app will update the corresponding values in the `app_config` table in the database.
    *   The app will then show a "PINs updated successfully" confirmation message and likely navigate the user back to the previous screen.

This feature is the final piece of the security and administration puzzle, giving the Super Admin full control over the application's access credentials.

Does this plan for the PIN Management feature align with your vision?
